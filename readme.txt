Quick walkthrough for using this codebase

1. Run data_handle.py
   terminal command: python data_handler.py
2. Use the main.ipynb
3. cleaned_data_EDA.ipynb has few quick EDA steps taken before training.

Note: Across the codebase, where any custom files are being accessed, a try-except block is available to download
backup from google drive if the file was not found in the directory.

Note 2: The keras tuner logs are dumped into google drive, were too large for moodle submission:
