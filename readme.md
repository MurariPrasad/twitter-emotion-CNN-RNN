## Comparison of CNN and RNN models for Text Classification using Twitter Emotion Dataset

***Project for Deep Learning module. MSc Computer Science (NL), University College Dublin***


This project aims at comparing models to perform text classification of the Twitter Emotion Dataset. 
Text classification is a well known domain in deep learning, and in the current era of Transformer 
models and Generative AI, this project is a basic exploration of the simpler methods. 


Text Classification has been performed on pre-trained glove-25 embeddings using a sequentially accomodating 
CNN network, and then for a more traditionally sequential method, a basic Bi-Directional RNN network is used. 
Both attempts have been made using Keras Tuner to find the best network architecture and hyperparameters. 
This project has been implemented using Tensorflow.
